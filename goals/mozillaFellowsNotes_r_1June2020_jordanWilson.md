#### Jordan Wilson's theme


Privacy control, hacking and basic database security

#### Literature
 * Theme: how has hacking disrupted a person's privacy?
  * Find two or three articles concerning how privacy is lost from hacking databases  
  * Find system of hosting a sql database (Flask, Django or similar)
	* Start thinking of interesting personal data (that is all made-up information that appears to be highly personal) to host on the database. Students will hack-into and steal this information as a class activity
	* Start thinking of a hacking "tutorial" to help students break into the database.
	* Hacking is to teach how to make a database secure (i.e., decisions to make regarding the amount, type of data being held in the database, security, encryption and etc.)
	* Start thinking about leading questions to discuss how the information can be used to ruin someone's life and violate their privacy.


#### Coding Goal
Generate a model in which students are able to hack a database and to allow them to extract "personal" information from the database. Provide discussion questions about how this information could lead to identity theft and a serious overall personal privacy violation.

###### Purpose:
To demonstrate how information can be lost by hacking an SQL database. How can personal privacy be threatened by hacking a SQL database? Discuss what these hacking mechanisms are and how they are applied.
