## First Article
Capital One data breach Compromises Data of over 100 million

### Notes:

This article talks about how personal data and privacy is lost by a hack that was against capital one which is a very large banking corporation. A software engineer from Seattle hacked into a server holding that was filled with information for capital one. The suspect was a former employee that worked for Amazon Web Services. According to documents, the suspect stole 140,000 social security numbers and 80,000 bank account numbers in the breach. Capital One isn't new to security breaches as they have encountered problems in the past. This article is an example of how privacy can be lost from hacks that happen to databases. Its says that the suspect stole 140,000 social security numbers in the hack, meaning theoretically, they have stolen 140,000 different identities. How exactly is this ethical?

## Second Article
Equifax Data Breach

### Summary:
Equifax, one of the three largest consumer credit reporting agencies in the United States, announced in September 2017 that its systems had been breached and the sensitive personal data of 148 million Americans had been compromised. The data breached included names, home addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, social security numbers, and driverâ€™s license numbers. The credit card numbers of approximately 209,000 consumers were also breached. The Equifax breach is unprecedented in scope and severity. There have been larger security breaches by other companies in the past, but the sensitivity of the personal information held by Equifax and the scale of the problem makes this breach unprecedented. This completely violates privacy issues as millions of Americans had their information stolen. How could Americans go back to trusting this company if their information had been stolen with them?
